This will follow the Odin Project's binary tree project. An unsorted array will be sorted and any duplicate values will be removed using a modified version of the merge sort code I previously implemented. The binary tree will have various useful methods according to the specifications of the Odin Project.

This will demonstrate my ability to make and utilize binary trees.
